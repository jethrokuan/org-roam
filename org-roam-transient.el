;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Add a transient menu (https://magit.vc/manual/transient/) for
;; org-roam. To use the menu, bind `org-roam-menu' to a key, e.g,
;; (using the `bind-key' package from
;; https://github.com/priyadarshan/bind-key):
;;
;; (bind-key "C-c n" 'org-roam-menu)
;;
;;; Code:
(require 'transient)

;;;###autoload
(transient-define-prefix org-roam-menu ()
  "Transient menu for org-roam."
  [("l" "show/hide org-roam buffer" org-roam)
   ("f" "open an org-roam file" org-roam-find-file)
   ("g" "display the org-roam graph" org-roam-graph)
   ("i" "insert org-roam link" org-roam-insert)
   ("I" "insert org-roam link using template" org-roam-insert-immediate)])

(provide 'org-roam-transient)
