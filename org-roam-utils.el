;;; Commentary:

;;;; Library Requires
(require 'dash)
(require 's)

(defvar org-roam-verbose)

;; This is necessary to ensure all dependents on this module see
;; `org-mode-hook' and `org-inhibit-startup' as dynamic variables,
;; regardless of whether Org is loaded before their compilation.

;;;; Utility Functions

Like `org-fontify-like-in-org-mode', but supports `org-ref'."
  ;; NOTE: pretend that the temporary buffer created by `org-fontify-like-in-org-mode' to
  ;; fontify a `cite:' reference has been hacked by org-ref, whatever that means;
  ;;
  ;; `org-ref-cite-link-face-fn', which is used to supply a face for `cite:' links, calls
  ;; `hack-dir-local-variables' rationalizing that `bibtex-completion' would throw some warnings
  ;; otherwise.  This doesn't seem to be the case and calling this function just before
  ;; `org-font-lock-ensure' (alias of `font-lock-ensure') actually instead of fixing the alleged
  ;; warnings messes the things so badly that `font-lock-ensure' crashes with error and doesn't let
  ;; org-roam to proceed further. I don't know what's happening there exactly but disabling this hackery
  ;; fixes the crashing.  Fortunately, org-ref provides the `org-ref-buffer-hacked' switch, which we use
  ;; here to make it believe that the buffer was hacked.
  ;;
  ;; This is a workaround for `cite:' links and does not have any effect on other ref types.
  ;;
  ;; `org-ref-buffer-hacked' is a buffer-local variable, therefore we inline
  ;; `org-fontify-like-in-org-mode' here
