While exporting your documents to another format such as HTML -- whether using Org's in-built export or ox-hugo -- you can add a backlinks section which would display the backlinks to the current file. This is done via org-export's preprocessing hooks. See more at [Advanced Export Configuration (The Org Manual)](https://orgmode.org/manual/Advanced-Export-Configuration.html#Advanced-Export-Configuration).

Following are two different configs that might be suitable for different use-cases. Add one of these snippets in your Emacs init file.


### Only Backlinks

This would display only the backlinks and not the contents.

```emacs-lisp
(defun my/org-roam--backlinks-list (file)
  (if (org-roam--org-roam-file-p file)
      (--reduce-from
       (concat acc (format "- [[file:%s][%s]]\n"
                           (file-relative-name (car it) org-roam-directory)
			                     (org-roam--get-title-or-slug (car it))))
       "" (org-roam-db-query [:select [from] :from links :where (= to $s1)] file))
    ""))

(defun my/org-export-preprocessor (backend)
  (let ((links (my/org-roam--backlinks-list (buffer-file-name))))
    (unless (string= links "")
      (save-excursion
      	(goto-char (point-max))
      	(insert (concat "\n* Backlinks\n") links)))))

(add-hook 'org-export-before-processing-hook 'my/org-export-preprocessor)
```


### Backlinks and Contents

This would insert both backlinks and the contents, just like the org-roam buffer. This might be especially useful if you host a web version of your personal knowledgebase and want to browse the files along with the backlinks from mobile devices.

```emacs-lisp
(defun my/org-roam--backlinks-list-with-content (file)
  (with-temp-buffer
    (if-let* ((backlinks (org-roam--get-backlinks file))
              (grouped-backlinks (--group-by (nth 0 it) backlinks)))
        (progn
          (insert (format "\n\n* %d Backlinks\n"
                          (length backlinks)))
          (dolist (group grouped-backlinks)
            (let ((file-from (car group))
                  (bls (cdr group)))
              (insert (format "** [[file:%s][%s]]\n"
                              file-from
                              (org-roam--get-title-or-slug file-from)))
              (dolist (backlink bls)
                (pcase-let ((`(,file-from _ ,props) backlink))

                  (insert (s-trim (s-replace "\n" " " (plist-get props :content))))
                  (insert "\n\n")))))))
    (buffer-string)))




  (defun my/org-export-preprocessor (backend)
    (let ((links (my/org-roam--backlinks-list-with-content (buffer-file-name))))
      (unless (string= links "")
        (save-excursion
          (goto-char (point-max))
          (insert (concat "\n* Backlinks\n") links)))))

  (add-hook 'org-export-before-processing-hook 'my/org-export-preprocessor)
```
