;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Intercept calls from emacsclient for `roam://' links.
;;
;; This is done by advising `server-visit-files' to scan the list of filenames
;; for `org-roam-protocol-the-protocol'.
;;
;; `roam://' links are expected to be absolute file locations, for example,
;; `roam:///home/me/file.org'. The `roam://' prefix is stripped, and emacsclient
;; opens the location as per usual.
;;
;; Any application that supports calling external programs with an URL as
;; argument may be used with this functionality.
;;
;; Usage:
;; ------
;;
;;    1.) Add this to your init file:
;;        (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-roam-protocol.el"')
;;        (require 'org-roam-protocol)
;;
;;    2.) Ensure emacs-server is up and running.
;;    3.) Try this from the command line:
;;        $ emacsclient roam:///tmp/test.org
;;
;;    If it works, you can now setup other applications for using this feature.

  "This is the protocol to detect if org-roam-protocol.el is loaded.

;;; Code:
(defun org-roam-protocol-check-filename-for-protocol (fname)
  "Check if `org-roam-protocol-the-protocol' is used in FNAME.

If the protocol is found, the protocol is stripped from fname,
and the value is passed to the server as filename.

If the function returns nil, the filename is removed from the
list of filenames passed from emacsclient to the server. If the
function returns a non-nil value, that value is passed to the
server as filename."
