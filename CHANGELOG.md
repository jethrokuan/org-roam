### Breaking Changes
* [#143][gh-143] `org-roam-mode` is now a global mode. The installation instructions have changed accordingly.
* [#103][gh-103] Change `org-roam-file-format` to a function: `org-roam-file-name-function` to allow more flexible file name customizaton. Also changes `org-roam-use-timestamp-as-filename` to `org-roam-filename-noconfirm` to better describe what it does.

### Changes

* [#108][gh-108] Locally overwrite the link following behaviour in the org-roam-buffer to open files in the same window `org-roam` was called from
